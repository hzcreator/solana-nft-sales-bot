THE COMPLETE GUIDE ON MAKING A SALES BOT FOR SOLANA NFT's 

First, Download the code. Next open your code editor and open the code in there. Nextly head over to the Config files and input your projects cm id which you can find on solscan.io and enter the webhook url in front of discord_url
Once this is done save the changes 
Now for hosting i prefer to use EpikHost ( https://panel.epikhost.xyz/ ) it is easy to use and free aswell! You can create a epikhost account from their discord server (https://discord.com/invite/Hh94cMfYGX).  
Then for creating a node js server you have to head to bot commands in their server and paste in eh!store buy 1 which will create a node.js server for you
then you can copy the codes there or drop the files. After that simply head over to the console and hit start!
Now the bot should be running, incase it stops you can head over to console and start again.
